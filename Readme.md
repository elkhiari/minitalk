### process
In computing, a process is an instance of a running program. It is an executing instance of a computer program that has a unique process identifier (PID) and consists of program code, data, and system resources, such as CPU time, memory, and input/output (I/O) operations.

Every program that runs on a computer creates one or more processes. A process can be a single-threaded program, or it can be a multi-threaded program with multiple threads of execution. Each process has its own address space, which means that it can only access its own memory and cannot access the memory of other processes.

Processes are managed by the operating system, which allocates system resources to each process and schedules the execution of each process on the CPU. The operating system provides system calls and APIs that allow programs to create, manage, and communicate with processes.

Processes can communicate with each other through interprocess communication (IPC) mechanisms, such as pipes, sockets, and shared memory. Processes can also create child processes using system calls like fork() or CreateProcess(). These child processes inherit certain properties of their parent process, such as their environment variables and file descriptors.

In summary, a process is an instance of a running program that has a unique process identifier, its own address space, and access to system resources, and is managed by the operating system.
